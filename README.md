Basic definition of JavaScript
1. JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, ...

=>Depending on the information you supply to a variable (such as this ‘ ‘ or " " to signify string values), JavaScript will automatically type it. The type of a variable, such as int, float, boolean, or String, must be declared in many other languages, including Java.

=>Some examples of weakly typed languages include JavaScript, PHP, Perl, and C. Some examples of strongly typed languages include Python, Ruby, C#, and Java. 

=>In computer programming, a language is strongly typed if it requires the specification of data types. A language is loosely typed, or weakly typed, when it does not require the explicit specification of different types of objects and variables. 

=>ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification created by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It was first released in 1997 as ECMA-262. The specification was later adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and standardized as a scripting language for web applications.2 Feb 2023

=>Backward compatibility is a design that is compatible with previous versions of itself. Forward compatibility is a design that is compatible with future versions of itself. Backward and forward compatibility protects your investments in: Hardware.

=>Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can convert JavaScript code written using the latest features to older versions of JavaScript. This allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features without having to worry about whether or not their code will work in older browsers.

=>Babel is a popular tool for React development, as React uses many of the latest JavaScript features. Babel can also be used to convert JavaScript code to a version that is compatible with Node.js.

=> compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster execution since no translation is needed during runtime. On the other hand, an interpreter translates code line by line during execution, making it easier to detect errors but potentially slowing down the program.
