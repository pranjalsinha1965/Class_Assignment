//the golden rules of javascript
// Casing being followed is camel casing for assignments and alos in practice for wiriting codes with strict case for node.js environment
// i, j and k should not be used use proper variable declaration and definitions

// What are variables?
/* Ans. Variables are used to store values. Javascript natively supports three basic types namely strings, boolean and numbers.the constant type 
is not supposed to be changed as the program runs. Literals are variables not only declared like strings, numbers and objects but they are not assigned
values */

// How can you access the string s present in an array using loops in javascript?
/* let i=0;
do {
    console.log(evens[i]);
}
    while(i < evens.length)
*/
// tell the difference in between let and var 
/*let =>block scope and values can be reassigned but it gives referrence error
var =>has functional scope and values can be reassigned but it gives another kind of error */

// const is always given an initial value and it can`t be reassigned again

// build a function using const to display full name 

// if node isn`t installed then use .html file extension

// always explain the function execution context and global execution context along the with output of the programme

// JIT, JVM, JRE Just in time compiler
/* go through the memory execution phase of chai aur code tutorial*/

// what javascript engine does actually ?
// define a function for defining 
// let and const block scoped
// advantage of dynamic typing
